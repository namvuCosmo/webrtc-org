The blog and twitter have been fairly quiet. Team is heads down on several
fronts:

  * Upcoming [IETF][1] in Taiwan, where Harald, Serge and Justin will be
    attending. (please come and say hi) You will also notice the high degree
    of activity on the [email][2] [lists][3].

  * [W3C first draft][4] of the API.

  * Getting [webkit patches][5] landed, enabling us to get a WebRTC enabled
    version of Chrome to the public. You'll notice the brilliant work by
    Ericsson, whom have been helping out a ton in driving this.

  * Optimize, Optimize, Optimize.

Hopefully our next post will be soon, and will include a more useful URL :)
